# Callback Server

This is an example of a callback server that can be built when using Deepgram's [callback feature](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/callback).

This particular server was built to be an example for the tutorial blog post ["No More Zapier Timeouts: Transcribe Large Audio Files with Deepgram and Zapier’s Webhooks"](https://deepgram.com/learn/no-more-zapier-timeouts-transcribe-large-audio-files-with-deepgram-and-zapier-s-w). In the tutorial, you can learn how to automate the transcription of large audio files with Amazon S3, Deepgram, Webhooks, and Zapier.

The server was deployed with [Fly.io](fly.io). A straightforward walkthrough to deploy the app can be found in the article ["Deploy Node.js App to Fly.io"](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/deploy-node-js-app-to-fly-io-fb0f7ea9c13a) by Hayk Simonyan.
